I am Alexander Shcherbakov. I am Russian. I was born and lived until the age of 18 in  Zabaikalsky region. It is very interesting region, I like it. My family likes it too. My parents and my brother live in Chita and I really miss them. So far, I am a student at ITMO University and live in Saint Petersburg. I like this University. I want to be good programmer and I hope that ITMO University can help me. My hobbies are programming and sport. Maybe I'll try sports programming and it will be my new hobby.
