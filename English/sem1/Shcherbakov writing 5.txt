My neighborhood is about ten kilometers from the city centre, but a metro station is not far away. I can walk to the metro in 15 minutes. 
There are many shops and a big supermarket near my house. Also in the house where I live and neighboring houses there are many bars and restaurants. I don't like shops and bars, but I think that it make my neighborhood good. This area is new so there are not museams and cultural centers here. 
So, I think that my neighborhood is good for living in it.
