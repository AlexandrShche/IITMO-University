Task 2:
Hello. My name is Sasha. I was born in Chita and spent my childhood there.
I studied at gymnasium number 12 and graduated from the 11th grade there.
My hobbies are programming and sport. Maybe I'll try sports programming and it will be my new hobby.
I don't like cheating in tests and sometimes get less points than those who cheated. But is not very bad.
I am studying at ITMO University and I am happy with it.
