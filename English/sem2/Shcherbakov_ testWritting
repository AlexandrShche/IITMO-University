My native town is Chita. 
This city is quite dirty, but somewhere beautiful and pretty. There are not many interesting places in this city. 
Not far from the city center there is a sports complex "SibVO". I like this place.
People who live nearby often come there to do sport and go for a walk. I ran and cycled there many times. I have been there a lot, so I like this place.
There is another place in the city that I really like. It is the palace of the Shumov brothers.
I like this place because it is a architectural monument and beatiful place.
