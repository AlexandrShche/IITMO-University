Hi Allice,
Thank you for your emails. I'm happy to help you plan your holiday in Chita. 
There are many interesting places and I hope that you will be happy too.
First, I recommend you to visit observation deck. It is beautiful place. 
Secondly, you should visit the city center and regional museum. You should like this.
Finally, I recommend you leave the city for nature. There are many beautiful lakes and rivers, plants and animals and much more. I love Siberian nature and I hope that you will be happy
Best wishes,
Alexander.
