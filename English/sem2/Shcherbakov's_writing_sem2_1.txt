Dear Mrs. and Mr. Brown, thank you for your interest in the student exchange program. My name is Alexander and I really want to study at a university in the UK. Today I study at ITMO University and spend most of my time studying and developing myself. Maybe I'll get a job.
In my free time, I usually read, play chess, play sports, and socialize. 
My family lives in the Trans-Baikal Territory. We communicate at a distance, but we try to do it more often. My brother will soon finish school and go to study in another city. My parents love to travel and learn something new. I love it too. So, I want to study in another country and improve my level of English and erudition.
I am looking forward your letter. Please give me a chance to see your country from the inside
Best wishes, Alexander.
